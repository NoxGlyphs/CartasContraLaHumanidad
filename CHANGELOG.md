- Shows everyone's picked cards once the Czar is ready.
- '>' indicator showing who the Czar is on the leaderboard.

  - All sets labeled official on [JSON Against Humanity](https://crhallberg.com/cah/).

### Changes
- The font of the cards more closely resembles the font on the actual card. It sill looks funky and I might change it later.

- The deck will run out and could have unintended consequences.
